FFA
==========

A Bukkit plugin which adds a new Gamemode called Free for All. This is where a player is teleported to a
random location in an arena (Teleport locations can be set by Operators) and is allowed to fight other
players who have already joined. All players have the same standard kit. Sign Listeners and exclusive
VIP kits are yet to be added.
